    // write up
    "aboutme": "I am a software engineer with over 3 years of working experience building scalable backend services (microservices, sync/async processes). As a technologist, there is always the perpetual curiosity to seek out new findings and different ways in solving problems. While building software, I take pride in the fact that the products I build could potentially reach out to millions of people around the world. When I'm not hard at work, you can find me in climbing gyms, wracking out my brains to solve complex wall problems.",
